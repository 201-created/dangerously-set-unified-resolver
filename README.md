# Ember JJ-Abrams Resolver

This project is tracking a new resolver based on ES6 semantics that has been extracted from (and used by) the following projects:

* https://github.com/stefanpenner/ember-app-kit
* https://github.com/dockyard/ember-appkit-rails

## Goal

The goal of this project is to come up with a new default resolver for the next major version of `Ember` (2.0).
